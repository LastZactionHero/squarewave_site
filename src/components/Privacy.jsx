        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Squarewave Inc. (“Squarewave”) operates several websites including squarewaveng.com. It is Squarewave’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>

        <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
        <p>Like most website operators, Squarewave collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Squarewave’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Squarewave’s visitors use its website.</p>

        <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
        <p>Certain visitors to Squarewave’s websites choose to interact with Squarewave in ways that require Squarewave to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Squarewave gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we may ask engineering contractors to provide an email address, name, contact information, and details about their technical specialities. In each case, Squarewave collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Squarewave. Squarewave does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

        <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
        <p>Squarewave discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Squarewave’s behalf or to provide services available at Squarewave’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Squarewave’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Squarewave will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Squarewave discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Squarewave believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Squarewave, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Squarewave website and have supplied your email address, Squarewave may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new contractor and networking opportunities in the contractor network, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Squarewave. Squarewave takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information. Squarewave may include member profiles in public outreach, such as newsletter emails or a blog post. This will only be done after receiving your explicit permission to do so.</p>


        <h3>Aggregate Information</h3>
        <p>Squarewave may share some non-identifiable aggregate information about our member community, including the number of members in the network, and aggregate skill set of our members. The purpose is to demonstrate the engineering capacity of the network, in order to attract clients and contract jobs for network members. Your personal identification will not be shared without explicitly requesting your permission.</p>

        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Squarewave uses cookies to help Squarewave identify and track visitors, their usage of Squarewave website, and their website access preferences. Squarewave visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Squarewave’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Squarewave’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

        <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
        <p>If Squarewave, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Squarewave goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Squarewave may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>


        <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
        <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Squarewave may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Squarewave’s sole discretion. Squarewave encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a WordPress.com account, you should also check your blog’s dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
